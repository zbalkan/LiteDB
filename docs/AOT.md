# Native AOT and source-generated entity mapping

LiteDB supports an opt-in typed-collection path for applications that publish with **Native AOT** and need to avoid runtime discovery of application model members. The path uses a C# incremental source generator to emit `EntityMapper` definitions at compile time. It replaces the former `LiteAotDatabase` wrapper and manual `EntityMapper` construction.

LiteDB itself targets `netstandard2.0` and `net8.0`; its AOT compatibility analysis is enabled only for the `net8.0` target. The consuming application must target **.NET 8 or later** when it publishes with Native AOT.

## Configure the consuming project

### Published packages

External applications use a matching pair of packages: the `LiteDB` runtime package and the compile-time-only `LiteDB.SourceGenerator` analyzer package. Keep both package versions identical. The analyzer is intentionally an explicit opt-in and does not add a runtime assembly reference.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  <LiteDbPackageVersion>REPLACE_WITH_THE_MATCHING_RELEASE_VERSION</LiteDbPackageVersion>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="LiteDB" Version="$(LiteDbPackageVersion)" />
  <PackageReference Include="LiteDB.SourceGenerator"
                    Version="$(LiteDbPackageVersion)"
                    PrivateAssets="all" />
</ItemGroup>
```

`PrivateAssets="all"` keeps the analyzer private when this configuration is used in a reusable library. Applications may also use it; it does not prevent the current project from running the analyzer. Do not replace the analyzer reference with a runtime DLL reference or manually add the generated source file. NuGet discovers the analyzer from the package automatically.

### In-repository development

The repository test projects use a project reference while developing LiteDB itself. It is equivalent to the published analyzer package for local source builds, but is not the external-consumer configuration.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="..\LiteDB\LiteDB.csproj" />
  <ProjectReference Include="..\LiteDB.SourceGenerator\LiteDB.SourceGenerator.csproj"
                    OutputItemType="Analyzer"
                    ReferenceOutputAssembly="false" />
</ItemGroup>
```

For Native AOT, configure the executable project as follows. The runtime identifier must match the target platform you publish for.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
  <InvariantGlobalization>true</InvariantGlobalization>
  <ILLinkTreatWarningsAsErrors>true</ILLinkTreatWarningsAsErrors>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Publish, for example, with:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true
```

## Use generated mappings

Mark each supported entity with `[BsonSourceGenerated]`. During compilation, the generator emits `LiteDB.Generated.LiteDbGeneratedMappings`. Register all generated maps with a mapper, then request a collection by an explicit name.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using LiteDB;
using LiteDB.Generated;

[BsonSourceGenerated]
public sealed class Customer
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [BsonField("name")]
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    public List<string> Tags { get; set; } = [];

    [BsonIgnore]
    public string? TransientValue { get; set; }
}

var mapper = new BsonMapper();
LiteDbGeneratedMappings.Register(mapper);

using var database = new LiteDatabase("customers.db", mapper);
var customers = database.GetGeneratedCollection<Customer>("customers");
```

`Register` must run before `GetGeneratedCollection<T>`. Calling it twice for the same mapper throws `InvalidOperationException`. Generated registration is kept in a dedicated metadata registry and does not populate or replace the ordinary mapper cache, so `GetCollection<T>` continues to build and use ordinary reflection-capable metadata regardless of registration order. `GetGeneratedCollection<T>` throws when either the generated entity map or its generated execution map is absent. It never falls back to the ordinary runtime-mapped collection path.

The generator automatically registers a direct execution map for every supported model. Supported values include scalars, `List<string>`, rank-one `string[]`, and `Dictionary<string, object?>`; supported scalars include Boolean, the signed and unsigned integer widths, Single, Double, Decimal, Char, String, enum, `byte[]`, `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `Guid`, `ObjectId`, and nullable value-type forms of those values. `LiteDbGeneratedMappings.Register(mapper)` is the only registration call required; consumers do not call `RegisterGeneratedExecutionMap` manually. Direct maps perform generated document conversion and reproduce `SerializeNullValues`, `TrimWhitespace`, `EmptyStringToNull`, and `EnumAsInteger`; every other mapper-shaping setting is rejected before data access. Generated smoke fixtures guard the broad `ToDocument(Type, object)` and `ToObject(Type, BsonDocument)` methods so an accidental fallback is observable and build-breaking. Ordinary `GetCollection<T>` remains the reflection-capable LiteDB API. See [SourceGeneratorPackage.md](SourceGeneratorPackage.md) for package-version policy, contributor package checks, and release requirements.

## Supported model subset

The first source-generated mapping slice is intentionally narrow. The generator accepts a directly annotated, top-level, sealed, non-generic `public` or `internal` class or mutable record class with an accessible parameterless constructor. Sealing the annotated type prevents a generated collection from receiving a derived runtime type whose additional members are absent from the generated map. The generator can flatten supported public read/write instance properties declared by the annotated class and its public or internal, top-level, non-generic base classes. Compiler-generated record members, such as `EqualityContract`, are not persisted. A base class may be abstract; only the sealed concrete derived class is marked and directly constructed.

`[BsonId]`, `[BsonField]`, and `[BsonIgnore]` are supported on inherited and directly declared properties. For a virtual override chain, the generator maps only the most-derived property and resolves a mapping attribute from that declaration first, then from the nearest overridden declaration. The generator also applies LiteDB's `Id` and `<TypeName>Id` ID conventions. A `List<string>` is serialized and materialized through generated loops rather than reflection-based collection activation. An unannotated public getter-only property that is not an ID convention is treated as a computed projection and is excluded from persistence; mark it with `[BsonIgnore]` if explicit documentation is preferred. A getter-only `[BsonId]`, `[BsonField]`, or conventional ID remains unsupported because the generated path cannot hydrate it. Mapped `new`-hidden members, duplicate effective BSON field names, and multiple resolved IDs across an inheritance hierarchy produce `LDBSG003` rather than an ambiguous map.

| Supported | Not supported by the generated path |
|---|---|
| Scalar properties and nullable scalar value types, enums, `byte[]`, `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `DateTimeOffset?`, `Guid`, and `ObjectId` | Parameterized and `[BsonCtor]` constructors |
| `List<string>`, rank-one `string[]`, and `Dictionary<string, object?>` containing BSON-native dynamic values | Other array element types, other list element types, sets, typed or custom dictionaries, nested entities, and `BsonRef` |
| `[BsonId]`, `[BsonField]`, and `[BsonIgnore]` on direct and inherited properties; mutable record classes; unannotated computed getter-only projections; virtual override chains | Fields, persisted getter-only or init-only properties, mapped `new`-hidden members, duplicate BSON field names or IDs, generic or nested model/base classes |
| Explicit collection names | Default collection-name resolution and runtime mapper callbacks |

### DateTimeOffset representation

Ordinary and source-generated mapping write `DateTimeOffset` and nullable `DateTimeOffset` values as BSON `DateTime` values containing the UTC instant. BSON DateTime precision is one millisecond, so the original offset and any sub-millisecond ticks are not retained. Reads therefore materialize a UTC `DateTimeOffset`, consistently across ordinary managed, generated managed, and Native AOT execution paths.

Generated readers also accept the ticks-and-offset embedded document emitted by earlier source-generator versions. This compatibility is read-only: all new writes use the canonical BSON DateTime representation, which keeps indexes and queries independent of the typed writer used for a field.

### String array representation

Rank-one `string[]` properties use a BSON Array and generated indexed copy loops. With `BsonMapper.SerializeNullValues` enabled, a null string array is persisted as BSON Null and deserializes as null; an empty array remains a non-null, empty `string[]`. Other array element types remain unsupported.

### Nullable scalar values

A nullable scalar value type is supported when its underlying value type is supported. With the default mapper setting, null members retain LiteDB's normal omission behavior. When `BsonMapper.SerializeNullValues` is enabled, a nullable scalar `null` is persisted as BSON Null and deserializes as `null` through the generated mapping path.

### Dynamic dictionary representation

`Dictionary<string, object?>` is supported as a constrained BSON-native dynamic document. The generated path stores it as a BSON Document. It accepts null, `BsonValue`, BSON-native scalar values, and recursively nested dictionaries or arrays/enumerables. On materialization, nested BSON documents become `Dictionary<string, object?>` and nested BSON arrays become `object?[]`; other BSON values retain their raw CLR values.

With the default mapper setting, a null dictionary member follows LiteDB's normal omission behavior. When `BsonMapper.SerializeNullValues` is enabled, a null dictionary is persisted as BSON Null and deserializes as `null`. Arbitrary CLR objects, including `DateTimeOffset` values inside the dictionary, are intentionally rejected with `InvalidOperationException`. Typed dictionaries, dictionary interfaces, custom dictionary types, and arbitrary nested entity graphs remain unsupported by the generated path.

Unsupported annotated shapes produce a fail-closed **error** diagnostic; the generated path never falls back to runtime member discovery. Use the existing runtime-mapped LiteDB APIs for models outside the supported generated subset.

| Diagnostic | Meaning | Typical remediation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LDBSG001` | Invalid source-generated model or inheritance hierarchy | Use a top-level, sealed, public/internal concrete class with an accessible parameterless constructor and supported base classes. |
| `LDBSG002` | Invalid source-generated property | Change, ignore, or remove an unsupported, inaccessible, indexed/static, or persisted getter-only property. |
| `LDBSG003` | Conflicting source-generated mapping | Remove duplicate mapped member names, IDs, conventional IDs, or effective BSON field names across the hierarchy. |

## Contributor validation

`LiteDB.AotTests` exercises generated registration, C2 direct scalar conversion with option-sensitive BSON golden documents and ordinary/direct cross-reads, mutable record classes, IDs, field and ignore attributes, `DateTimeOffset` values and cross-path reads, inherited and overridden properties, computed projections, `List<string>`, `string[]`, and dynamic-dictionary round trips. `LiteDB.AotSmokeTests` exercises an automatic C2 scalar execution checkpoint alongside generated scalar, nullable scalar, list, string-array, DateTimeOffset, inherited-property, computed-projection, and dynamic-dictionary workflows plus document, query, and stream scenarios. It also covers the wider runtime surface a published application depends on: LINQ-to-`BsonExpression` translation over a generated collection (relational and logical operators, string, enum, and `DateTime` members, captured locals, collection membership, ordering, paging, scalar and entity projections, aggregates, grouping, and bulk mutation), index creation and query-plan selection, transactions, the SQL command surface, maintenance pragmas and collection management, AES-encrypted file databases, and the BSON, JSON, and expression document runtime.

The smoke project is also the feature-parity contract between publish modes. The parity script publishes it as an ordinary untrimmed application, a trimmed managed single-file application, and a Native AOT application; it runs all three and requires their complete scenario transcripts to match byte for byte. A new smoke scenario therefore expands the regular, trimmed, and Native AOT gates together rather than relying on three independently maintained test lists. This verifies reachable behavior, not every public LiteDB API: reflection-based ordinary typed mapping remains intentionally outside the trimming-safe generated mapping contract described above.

Run the focused tests with:

```bash
dotnet test LiteDB.AotTests/LiteDB.AotTests.csproj -c Release
```

Run the Native AOT smoke test with:

```bash
dotnet publish LiteDB.AotSmokeTests/LiteDB.AotSmokeTests.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true
./LiteDB.AotSmokeTests/bin/Release/net8.0/linux-x64/publish/LiteDB.AotSmokeTests
```

Run the complete regular-versus-published feature-parity gate with:

```bash
./scripts/validate-aot-feature-parity.sh
```

The script runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and CI runs it on all three. It detects the host runtime identifier (`linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `win-x64`, `osx-x64`, or `osx-arm64`) and publishes for it; set `RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER` to override that choice or `AOT_PARITY_OUTPUT_ROOT` to retain the three publish trees and transcripts in another location. It needs the host's Native AOT toolchain: `clang` and the platform development libraries on Linux, the MSVC build tools on Windows, and the Xcode command line tools on macOS. On Windows run it from a Bash shell such as Git Bash.

Run the separate trimmed, non-AOT gate with:

```bash
dotnet publish LiteDB.AotSmokeTests/LiteDB.AotSmokeTests.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishAot=false -p:PublishTrimmed=true -o artifacts/aot-smoke-trimmed
./artifacts/aot-smoke-trimmed/LiteDB.AotSmokeTests
```

Run the package-boundary Native AOT validation with:

```bash
./scripts/validate-source-generator-package-consumer.sh
```

The command creates a temporary local feed and NuGet cache, packs a matching LiteDB/runtime-analyzer pair, verifies the analyzer archive, restores an external package consumer, and publishes/runs that consumer as Native AOT. Like the parity script, it publishes for the detected host runtime identifier and runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS, so it needs that host's Native AOT toolchain. It uses NuGet.org only for SDK Native AOT and linker tooling; the LiteDB package pair itself is created in the local feed.
